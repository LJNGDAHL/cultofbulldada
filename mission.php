  <h1 class="tb-content__headline">Our Mission </h1>
  <p class="tb-content__paragraph">This is a certified religion of scorn and vengeance directed at all of them, the enemies of us Outsiders. It is “self-help” thorugh scoffing and blaspheming, frenzied fornication and the Tumping of Graven Images. The Church provides answers and miracles in the service of sureavolution.</p>
  <p class="tb-content__paragraph">The Church of the Cult of Bulldada is the ultimate secret order, the superior brain cult for those who “know better” but who demand in the lust for grins a spectacular, special-effects-laden belief system — a ‘stuporstition.’</p>
  <p class="tb-content__paragraph">
    The Goal: Front End Development<br>
    The Method: The casting out of false prophets<br>
    The Weapon: Time Control<br>
    The Motto: Fuck them if they can’t take a joke<br>
  </p>
  <p class="tb-content__paragraph">This religion, devised by precise mathematical formulae, weirder than the most obscure UFO/Atlantis cults, is invaluable to all superior renegades who, at any time, are justifiably on the edge of insanity and can be made whole only by developing a seventh sense of bludgeon humor.</p>
