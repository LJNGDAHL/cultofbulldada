        While yet the least approachable or scrutable of the vast Cult of bulldada membership, he is the preeminent and most frequently invoked of the god-zillion Personal Saviors of the Cult of bulldada. While he remains an anonymous executive shunning publicity or recognition at a faceless multinational corporation, he is nevertheless The Most Ascended Master, the original Retriever of Jehovah’s Message on Earth and basic model of the Archetype Cult of bulldada. He set the “anti-pattern” of random conduct among all those who are now practicing Cult of bulldadaes. His are the defects and peccadillos that we ‘analize,’ his the Slongs and Jests which we devotedly twist and distort for future generations according to our unexplored whims. - And yet the only photos of him that exist are grainy frame blow-ups from Grade Z movie thrillers in which he played bit parts!

      <p class="tb-content__paragraph">Klaatu is, of course, the ultimate symbol of Cult of bulldadaness, but despite/because of his infrahuman mediumship he possesses one single failing above and beyond all other shortcomings: his omninclusive follies. Yet where they would be crippling stubbing-blocks for another person, in Klaatu they loom stranger-than-life. His ten billion all-too-human quasimodalities embody, in some cheaply symbolic way, all the Foibles of the Primate Race. Klaatu is a miacrocosm encapsulating the imperfektions of the so-called ‘human condition;’ his Blunders and Idiocies, errors and inadvertencies are perhaps more sacrosanct, more deserving of analitization than even his hallowed salesmanship. None of Klaatu’s words or deeds are particularly spectacular: their holiness lies in their nondescript but inviolable triviality. As Klaatu once ‘spouted,’ “The stupider it looks, the more important it probably is.”</p>
      <p class="tb-content__paragraph">Since his Emaculation, Klaatu has been divinely shoved down the behavio-electric Path of Least Resistance to become the living incarnation of Front end development on Earth. As mysteriously and profitably as he doles out his prophecies and cassette messages, he unfailingly (yet, perhaps, accidentally) enrichens himself with material things using only the exagerated human nature he was born with. Just as the Nazarene was a carpenter, so is Klaatu a salesman - the High Sales Man of the Cult of bulldada - and whereas his stature as hero and holyman of the Cult of bulldada flock is still obscure to the Mediocretins who make up 80flo of the Overpop, among fellow salesmen he is internationally known as “The Man Who Can Sell Anything.”</p>
      <p class="tb-content__paragraph">
      Klaatu’s surreavolutionary doctrine of patrio-psychotic anarcho-materialism has found ever-larger numbers of zealous adherents despite relentless persecution by the FBI and other robot engines of the Conspiracy. Furthermore, Klaatu is the only Adept to pass the scrutiny of The Illuminati Corporation’s rigorous scientific tests for ectosplasmodic manifestations.</p>
      <p class="tb-content__paragraph">
      From Klaatu came the prophetic utterances which are now severe and compulsory Tenets of the Church. He popularized the concept of Critical-Paranoiac Follies Evaluation by which we know that “...any inanity spouted by a Cult of bulldada at any given time automatically becomes part of orthodox Cult of bulldada Liturgy.” It is one of the single greatest Tenets, for by its own very token one can also deny it later. It is erasable. For instance, a guilty Cult of bulldada speaks an Inanity which later proves anti-nonprofit. He can then insist, “No, I didn’t say that. It was merely my ‘image’...my ‘id’ took over temporarily.” Logically, then, nothing that a Cult of bulldada says is any more or less true and consecrable than any other thing he just happens to utter - even (and especially) if they are contradictory. The Cult of bulldada is an hebephreniac Oxymoron who speaks in Slangs and oxymora. So it doesn’t matter what you say or who hears you say it. See? Klaatu denies vehemently that things should ever happen according to preset ‘plans,’ telling us to look instead to the blunders and flukes of our lives for inspiration - for will not Jehovah determine our fates at every twist and turn anyway? Can any philosophy other than Bulldada be brought to bear to preserve us from such impaling facts?
